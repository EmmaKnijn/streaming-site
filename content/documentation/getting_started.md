description: A guide that explains how to log into our web interface
---

To get started with Knijn Streaming *today*, there's some hurdles to cross.

We currently don't have a neat login flow to simply log you into our web interface, so follow the following steps:

Go to [our player](https://player.streaming.knijn.one) and press `Open menu`

Then, press `Manage servers` in the dropdown menu

Press `Add server`

Now log in with your username and password in this menu, and press `Add`

Now, if everything went well, you should be able to press `Go back` and be greeted with the music library

## Configuring your own client

If you have an OpenSubsonic client, you'll be able to use your own client

We suggest the following clients:

**Android**
- Symfonium
- Substreamer

**iOS**
- Substreamer
- play:Sub

**Desktop**
- Feishin

We don't develop these clients, but we will try our best to help out if you ask for support.

For your username and password, just enter them as you usually would on the web interface.
