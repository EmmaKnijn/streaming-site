We use various FOSS technologies and projects to run our service.

## Navidrome
The core of our streaming service relies on Navidrome, the versitile media server. It allows users to play music seamlessly and for them to bring their own music player too.

## Feishin
This powers our web player.

## Hugo
Hugo runs our website, with the congo theme. This is then served using Cloudflare Pages.
