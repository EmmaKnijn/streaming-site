description: The various technologies we use

We use various open source technologies and projects to run our service.

## [Navidrome](https://www.navidrome.org/)
The core of our streaming service relies on Navidrome, the versitile media server. It allows users to play music seamlessly and for them to bring their own music player too.

## [Feishin](https://github.com/jeffvli/feishin)
This powers our web player. We plan on moving to [audioling](https://github.com/audioling/audioling) once it is stable.

## [Hugo](https://gohugo.io)
Hugo runs our website, with the [congo](https://github.com/jpanther/congo) theme. This is then served using Cloudflare Pages for the best performance.
