## What do we do different?
- Fair monetary payment to artists
- Users can bring their **own** music player
- Direct contact with artists
- Directly serving artists' files with **no** quality loss
- Small, but good library

## Want to sign up?
You can do so, please contact EmmaKnijn using the methods linked [on her site](https://knijn.one).
During the beta period, access will be free until we have a billing system.

## Are you an artist or a developer?
Feel free to reach out too! We're looking for people willing to contribute.
